# crypto_exchange
Automated trading examples for the following exchanges:
Kraken

To be uploaded:
Poloniex, Gdax (coinbase pro), bitfinex,

Note these are meant as examples, they are not programs that have at any stage made a profit (why would I post a profitable program?). 

You will need to set up accounts with each exchange and set up the associated api keys. I can post/link to a tutorial if requested.
